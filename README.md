# 🎸 YT2TAB – Ultimate Guitar Tab Searcher

**YT2TAB** is a Chrome extension that seamlessly integrates **Spotify, YTMusic or Apple Music** playback with **Ultimate Guitar** tab searches. Automatically fetch tabs for songs as they play on YouTube with minimal effort.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **On/Off Toggle** – Activate or pause the extension’s functionality at any time.
- 🎯 **Tab Type Selection** – Choose from different tab types (e.g., Chords, Tabs, Pro, etc.).
  - Only **one tab type** can be active at a time.
  - Changing the tab type triggers a new search automatically.
- 🔄 **Auto-Sync** – As the next track starts playing on YouTube:
  - YT2TAB will search Ultimate Guitar for the new song.
  - If a UG tab is already open, it updates that one.
  - If no Ultimate Guitar tab is open, a new one is created.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Toggle it ON** when you're ready.
2. **Pick your preferred tab type** (e.g., Chords, Tabs, Pro).
3. Let media play — YT2TAB will detect track changes and auto-search UG.
4. Tabs open in the first available UG window or a new one if needed.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer Mode** (top right).
4. Click **"Load unpacked"** and select the extension folder.

## 🤘 Use Cases

- Jamming along to a YouTube playlist? Let YT2TAB keep your tabs ready.
- Learning a setlist? Automatically get relevant tabs without needing to search manually.

## 💡 Notes

- YT2TAB relies on YTmusic/Spotify's/Apple Musics metadata for song titles.
- Results depend on what’s available on Ultimate Guitar.
- A new UG tab opens only if one isn't already present.
- THE USER WILL STILL NEED TO SELECT THE APPROPRIATE TAB FROM UG SEARCH RESULTS
